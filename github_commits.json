`PHPUnit\\Event\\Test\\PreparationStartedSubscriber` throws an Exception.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nThe test that has had preparation started is silently discarded. There are no indications that the test failed.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an Extension.\r\n2. Register a PreparationStartedSubscriber and throw an Exception.\r\n3. Ensure the Extension is set to be loaded in your PHPUnit Configuration.\r\n4. Execute PHPUnit and see that no tests are run.\r\n\r\nI have also reproduced this in an isolated repo: https://github.com/cspray/phpunit10-bugs under the `PreparationStartedException` directory.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect a test that has an exception thrown in a `PreparationStartedSubscriber` to be properly marked as a failure/error with information on the Exception that was thrown.\r\n\r\n#### Composer Info Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyclabs/deep-copy                  1.11.0             Create deep copies (clones) of your objects\r\nnikic/php-parser
