we do not provide our own mocking library it is expected that a complex test suite will require mocks at some point. We should design a system that allows you to define which mocking system to use and an abstraction layer will know how to integrate that system into the framework. A more complete design Proposal should be created.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-17T13:42:27Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}},{"id":"17202226807","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":358545205,"name":"labrador-kennel/async-unit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit"},"payload":{"action":"closed","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/issues/99","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/issues/99/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/issues/99/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/issues/99/events","html_url":"https://github.com/labrador-kennel/async-unit/issues/99","id":903690297,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MDM2OTAyOTc=","number":99,"title":"Differentiate between a test failure and test error","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2919646429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE5NjQ2NDI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/milestones/6","html_url":"https://github.com/labrador-kennel/async-unit/milestone/6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/milestones/6/labels","id":6671111,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjY3MTExMQ==","number":6,"title":"0.6.0 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":5,"closed_issues":2,"state":"open","created_at":"2021-04-17T16:17:44Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:56Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-05-27T12:48:46Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:56Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"A test is considered not-passing in one of two ways in our current system; the test failed or the test was disabled. Failure occurs if _any_ exception is thrown during the test. This is not an accurate representation of what has actually occurred within the test. A _failure_ should be when an assertion has occurred or the test explicitly throws a `TestFailedException`. An exception that is not expected or was thrown in error should not be considered a failure. It should be considered an _error_ and should throw a `TestErrorException`. The CLI result printer should differentiate between a test failing and a test encountering an unexpected error. The difference between these 2 types of exceptions is important enough to ensure the end-user receives this information.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:56Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}},{"id":"17202225729","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":358545205,"name":"labrador-kennel/async-unit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit"},"payload":{"push_id":7539948587,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/main","head":"f00aca0e524e59d6a96943247429c53421f151cc","before":"fd0da45af06a480f9b0d46a54ff05748c66a2927","commits":[{"sha":"f00aca0e524e59d6a96943247429c53421f151cc","author":{"email":"cspray@users.noreply.github.com","name":"Charles"},"message":"Add errored state and adjust statistics (#102)\n\n* Add errored state and adjust statistics\r\n\r\n* Attempt to increase memory limit\r\n\r\n* Next attempt at setting phpunit action memory limit\r\n\r\n* Update changelog","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/commits/f00aca0e524e59d6a96943247429c53421f151cc"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:39Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}},{"id":"17202225689","type":"DeleteEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":358545205,"name":"labrador-kennel/async-unit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit"},"payload":{"ref":"task/error-state/99","ref_type":"branch","pusher_type":"user"},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-17T13:39:39Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}}]
