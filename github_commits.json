now you can only disable a test statically, sometimes you might want to disable a test only if certain conditions are met. For example, if the code under test is optional for your application and requires a certain extension the test suite should disable any tests that require that extension if it is not available. This is currently not possible. We should avoid introducing a `TestCase::markDisabled`... it requires all of the hooks and test processing to still be invoked when we could, and should, be skipping past these potentially costly, error-triggering procedures. Instead we should introduce a `#[DisabledIf($method, $reason)]` Attribute. The `$method` should be a public method on the class it was annotated on. If it returns true the test will be disabled otherwise it will run as normal.
