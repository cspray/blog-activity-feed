Fortunately, I believe the event system could simplify what we'd have to do.\r\n\r\nA tl;dr is that we create an [`Extension`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/3126416bca5955bdb9cebf21aeb233ddc1a8418d/src/Runner/Extension/Extension.php) that invokes `EventLoop::getSuspension()->suspend()` in an appropriate event.
