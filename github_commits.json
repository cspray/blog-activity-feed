for the useful software! After using localstack in a docker-compose project I thought it might be beneficial for a container health-check to be supported directly by the [localstack/localstack](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack/#!) container. As it would be hard to provide tests for something like this I provided a screenshot of `docker ps` with these changes in my local environment.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/771345/174446367-e169e48e-853a-46c0-86b0-1a13e70a9b60.png)\r\n\r\n> Note: To get this branch working in your own local environment you'll need to either build and run the Docker container directly or update the `docker-compose.yml` file to build from the local Dockerfile and not pull an image from Dockerhub.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming there's some build process in the localstack CI/CD that will generate the appropriate container image and push it to Dockerhub. If there are additional changes necessary for this I'll be more than happy to implement them with some guidance.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering my PR!\r\n\r\n_Commit message below_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdds a healthcheck to Dockerfile and Dockerfile.rh. Using curl it will\r\nping the /health endpoint every 10s, starting 15s after the container\r\nhas started running. If the /health endpoint returns any failure\r\nresponse the container will be marked unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 primary motivations for adding this directly to the Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n1. Potentially less boilerplate in docker-compose.yml files that make use of\r\n   localstack.\r\n2. Docker container health status is no longer reliant on docker-compose\r\n   to determine. If you're running just the localstack container\r\n   you'll still be able to get access to the health.\r\n\r\n**Please refer to the contribution guidelines in the README when submitting PRs.**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/comments/1162503484","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297#issuecomment-1162503484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297","id":1162503484,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBEnY0s5FSmU8","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-22T00:50:21Z","updated_at":"2022-06-22T00:50:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the useful feedback @alexrashed.

This document is intended to act as a long-running list for the types of logical constraints that have been accounted for, are planned to account for, or are intentionally not going to account for. A future phase of the project will involve implementing the logical constraints listed here.\r\n\r\nConstraints are categorized by their type. The current constraint types are:\r\n\r\n- **Notice** These might indicate something is wrong but could be handled at runtime\r\n- **Warning** There is a large probability that this constraint violation will result in some error\r\n- **Critical** It is all but certain that attempting to use the code in this configuration will result in an error.\r\n\r\n## Accounted For Constraints\r\n\r\n- [x] If an abstract service does not have any concrete services defined for it. _Warning_\r\n- [x] If an abstract service has more than 1 alias defined for it. _Notice_\r\n\r\n## Planned to Account For Constraints\r\n\r\nWhile this is intended to be an exhaustive list it might be possible that conditions exist the author has not considered. If you believe that there's a violation missing in this list of constraints please comment below.\r\n\r\n### Critical\r\n\r\n- [ ] If you duplicate the name of a `#[Service]`.\r\n- [ ] If you annotate a class method with `#[ServiceDelegate]` that has private or protected visibility.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\n\r\n- [ ] If you annotate a class property with `#[Inject]` without also annotating the class with `#[Configuration]`. _Warning_\r\n\r\n### Notice\r\n\r\n## Intentionally Will-Not-Fix\r\n\r\n_No known logical constraints will be ignored._</div>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-18T21:19:06Z"},{"id":"22410918473","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":71948498,"name":"localstack/localstack","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297","id":1275822463,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBEnY0s455PXd","number":6297,"title":"Add HEALTHCHECK to Dockerfile","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2022-06-18T15:54:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T18:12:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/6297","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297","diff_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThanks for the useful software!

I wouldn't necessarily want to impede on this type of workflow. I'd be open to providing a way to \"fake\" the health check for this type of use case. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAKE_HEALTHCHECK=1 docker run ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is explicitly set it can be assumed there's some reason, for example a 1-off, and you know what you're doing.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, multiple Dockerfile could be provided. Perhaps this Dockerfile becomes the one to use for one-off running and a `Dockerfile.infra` (or similar) has the healthcheck. I'm not familiar enough with the project to be able to know what other repercussions this might have.\r\n\r\nFrom a technically pure perspective the separate Dockerfile feels like a better solution.

As it would be hard to provide tests for something like this I provided a screenshot of `docker ps` with these changes in my local environment.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/771345/174446367-e169e48e-853a-46c0-86b0-1a13e70a9b60.png)\r\n\r\n> Note: To get this branch working in your own local environment you'll need to either build and run the Docker container directly or update the `docker-compose.yml` file to build from the local Dockerfile and not pull an image from Dockerhub.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming there's some build process in the localstack CI/CD that will generate the appropriate container image and push it to Dockerhub. If there are additional changes necessary for this I'll be more than happy to implement them with some guidance.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering my PR!\r\n\r\n_Commit message below_\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdds a healthcheck to Dockerfile and Dockerfile.rh. Using curl it will\r\nping the /health endpoint every 10s, starting 15s after the container\r\nhas started running. If the /health endpoint returns any failure\r\nresponse the container will be marked unhealthy.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 primary motivations for adding this directly to the Dockerfile:\r\n\r\n1. Potentially less boilerplate in docker-compose.yml files that make use of\r\n   localstack.\r\n2. Docker container health status is no longer reliant on docker-compose\r\n   to determine. If you're running just the localstack container\r\n   you'll still be able to get access to the health.\r\n\r\n**Please refer to the contribution guidelines in the README when submitting PRs.**\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-18T15:54:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T15:54:52Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/6297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/6297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/330e3241ed7d4bff0bc9577505df4f7f5a22c7ba","head":{"label":"cspray:feature/dockerfile-healthcheck","ref":"feature/dockerfile-healthcheck","sha":"330e3241ed7d4bff0bc9577505df4f7f5a22c7ba","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":504691298,"node_id":"R_kgDOHhT6Yg","name":"localstack","full_name":"cspray/localstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cspray/localstack","description":"💻  A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.
