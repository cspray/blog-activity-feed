`PHPUnit\\Event\\Test\\PreparationStartedSubscriber` throws an Exception.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nThe test that has had preparation started is silently discarded. There are no indications that the test failed.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an Extension.\r\n2. Register a PreparationStartedSubscriber and throw an Exception.\r\n3. Ensure the Extension is set to be loaded in your PHPUnit Configuration.\r\n4. Execute PHPUnit and see that no tests are run.\r\n\r\nI have also reproduced this in an isolated repo: https://github.com/cspray/phpunit10-bugs under the `PreparationStartedException`

10 has recently been released and it includes improvements to the testing framework along with a new Event system. Unfortunately, it also brings along a breaking change that causes this library to no longer work. Specifically, the `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase::setName` method has been marked as final and can no longer be overridden. Fortunately, I believe the event system could simplify what we'd have to do.\r\n\r\nA tl;dr is that we create an [`Extension`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/3126416bca5955bdb9cebf21aeb233ddc1a8418d/src/Runner/Extension/Extension.php) that invokes `EventLoop::getSuspension()->suspend()` in an appropriate event. The first thought is the [`PHPUnit\\Event\\Events\\Test\\Finished`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/3126416bca5955bdb9cebf21aeb233ddc1a8418d/src/Event/Events/Test/Lifecycle/Finished.php) event.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a good place to start I can work on a new branch for PHPUnit 10 support in the next week or two.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amphp/phpunit-util/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amphp/phpunit-util/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-15T15:39:54Z","org":{"id":8865682,"login":"amphp","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/amphp","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8865682?"}},{"id":"27092905011","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":29277692,"name":"labrador-kennel/http","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http"},"payload":{"action":"opened","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/events","html_url":"https://github.com/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40","id":1584944380,"node_id":"I_kwDOAb69_M5eeFT8","number":40,"title":"Output
