now you can only disable a test statically, sometimes you might want to disable a test only if certain conditions are met. For example, if the code under test is optional for your application and requires a certain extension the test suite should disable any tests that require that extension if it is not available. This is currently not possible. We should avoid introducing a `TestCase::markDisabled`... it requires all of the hooks and test processing to still be invoked when we could, and should, be skipping past these potentially costly, error-triggering procedures. Instead we should introduce a `#[DisabledIf($method, $reason)]` Attribute. The `$method` should be a public method on the class it was annotated on. If it returns true the test will be disabled otherwise it will run as normal.

An Attribute and a configuration value should be introduced that allows defining a namespace or filepath for a TestSuite class. Any TestCase that falls under that namespace or filepath should be attached to that TestSuite.\r\n\r\nSomething to consider is the potential for conflicts where a namespace or filepath could result in multiple TestSuites to be associated with. We should likely throw an exception if a scenario like this is encountered.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-18T21:26:57Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}},{"id":"17207708021","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":358545205,"name":"labrador-kennel/async-unit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit"},"payload":{"push_id":7543468956,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/main","head":"60c747fe8540a62cb7454de147a4cdad0292e6ac","before":"82f650d8aaba5f529e9928791b44ccb1654d331c","commits":[{"sha":"60c747fe8540a62cb7454de147a4cdad0292e6ac","author":{"email":"cspray@users.noreply.github.com","name":"Charles"},"message":"Allow defining test suite for all test cases matching a namespace (#104)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit/commits/60c747fe8540a62cb7454de147a4cdad0292e6ac"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-18T16:23:23Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}},{"id":"17207707994","type":"DeleteEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":358545205,"name":"labrador-kennel/async-unit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/async-unit"},"payload":{"ref":"feature/test-suite-attach-case-by-namespace/85","ref_type":"branch","pusher_type":"user"},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-18T16:23:23Z","org":{"id":17804504,"login":"labrador-kennel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/labrador-kennel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17804504?"}}]
