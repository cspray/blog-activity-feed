bare-minimum, proof-of-concept implementation for gathering all ReflectionAttributes from a given source.

Thanks for the awesome library! I have a use case for statically analyzing Attributes in a PHP codebase. To facilitate this I added a `Reflector::reflectAllAttributes()` method that will return a list of ReflectionAttribute instances. Before I continued with this work I wanted to get the maintainers feedback to:\r\n\r\n1. See if this feature is even desired by the team and would be open to merging in to the codebase.\r\n2. Collaborate on possible concerns with the implementation and to solidify the changes to the Reflector API.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n1. Finish testing and implementing the `ReflectionAttribute::createFromNode` method to construct the correct reflection for the node that owns the attribute.\r\n2. Introduce additional methods on the `Reflector` interface for narrowing the ReflectionAttributes returned.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-16T18:51:25Z","updated_at":"2022-04-16T18:51:25Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roave/BetterReflection/pulls/1082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roave/BetterReflection/pulls/1082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roave/BetterReflection/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roave/BetterReflection/issues/1082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Roave/BetterReflection/statuses/0cc8543238091e4488f18d82860ecf2b96150973","head":{"label":"cspray:feature/reflector-reflect-all-attributes","ref":"feature/reflector-reflect-all-attributes","sha":"0cc8543238091e4488f18d82860ecf2b96150973","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":482292186,"node_id":"R_kgDOHL8x2g","name":"BetterReflection","full_name":"cspray/BetterReflection","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cspray/BetterReflection","description":":crystal_ball:

a known problem where third-party code that can't be annotated is not able to be parsed and used by our library in the normal use-case. While a user could manually define their own `ContainerDefinition` using a `ContainerDefinitionBuilder` we shouldn't encourage end-users to actually make use of this. It is specifically designed for handling the results of static analysis parsing and several aspects of it would be unwieldy to use manually. However, there are various abstractions we can provide that would make use of these builders to allow more easily configuring third-party code or code that can't be annotated.\r\n\r\nFor now, 2 different APIs should be designed that allow configuring third-party code; a set of Annotations that can be defined on a marker interface that designate the third-party configuration and a set of functions that create the appropriate definitions and attach them to the builder.\r\n\r\n## Marker Interface approach\r\n\r\nIn this approach the user would provide an interface in the directory of scanned code that would allow them to place annotations on it. All of the available Attributes would need to have third-party versions created for them. Generally these third-party Attributes will be similar to their first-party counterparts, except for where we can infer data; in those places you'll need to explicitly define what type is being dealt with. An example Attribute might look like...\r\n\r\n`#[ThirdPartyService(string $type, ?string $name, array $profiles, bool $isPrimary)]`\r\n\r\nThis approach has the added advantage that third-party libraries can become pseudo-annotated. New packages only provide marker interfaces that properly annotates third-party code. Those packages can then be included as a dependency and have their annotations parsed by ensuring the proper vendor folder is scanned. This ensures that the end-user isn't required to merge ContainerDefinition together or otherwise mess with their app's bootstrap to configure the Container with third-party code.\r\n\r\n## Functional approach\r\n\r\nIn this approach we'd have a functional API that can be used to generate a ContainerDefinition. We'd provide an entry-point for building a ContainerDefinition by calling a method and providing a callable; the callable will be executed in such a way that the resultant function calls will populate the ContainerDefinition with the appropriate sub-definitions. Below is an example for how this might work when creating a third-party service definition and service delegate.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$ogDefinition = fromOriginalCompilation();\r\n\r\n$containerDefinition = containerDefinition(function() {\r\n    service($this, LoggerInterface::class);\r\n    serviceDelegate($this, LoggerInterface::class, MyLoggerFactory::class, 'create');\r\n});\r\n\r\n$newDefinition = $ogDefinition->merge($containerDefinition);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-09T12:11:40Z"},{"id":"21200417473","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":354553154,"name":"cspray/annotated-container","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container"},"payload":{"push_id":9581722919,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/main","head":"b6b98132218ce3cb686ddf83ae92fa3507dc4efa","before":"f372ed9cb42ff31d991527d42905324027dc5bf7","commits":[{"sha":"b6b98132218ce3cb686ddf83ae92fa3507dc4efa","author":{"email":"cspray@users.noreply.github.com","name":"Charles"},"message":"Feature/third
