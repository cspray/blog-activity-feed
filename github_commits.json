10 has recently been released and it includes improvements to the testing framework along with a new Event system. Unfortunately, it also brings along a breaking change that causes this library to no longer work. Specifically, the `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase::setName` method has been marked as final and can no longer be overridden. Fortunately, I believe the event system could simplify what we'd have to do.\r\n\r\nA tl;dr is that we create an [`Extension`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/3126416bca5955bdb9cebf21aeb233ddc1a8418d/src/Runner/Extension/Extension.php) that invokes `EventLoop::getSuspension()->suspend()` in an appropriate event. The first thought is the [`PHPUnit\\Event\\Events\\Test\\Finished`](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/3126416bca5955bdb9cebf21aeb233ddc1a8418d/src/Event/Events/Test/Lifecycle/Finished.php) event.\r\n\r\nIf

two.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amphp/phpunit-util/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amphp/phpunit-util/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-15T15:39:54Z","org":{"id":8865682,"login":"amphp","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/amphp","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8865682?"}},{"id":"27092905011","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":29277692,"name":"labrador-kennel/http","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http"},"payload":{"action":"opened","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40/events","html_url":"https://github.com/labrador-kennel/http/issues/40","id":1584944380,"node_id":"I_kwDOAb69_M5eeFT8","number":40,"title":"Output
