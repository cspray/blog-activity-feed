Discussed in https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container/discussions/44\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **cspray** April  3, 2022</sup>\r\nAnnotated Container has the capacity to analyze your annotations and tell you when there might be something wrong, they're called _logical constraints_. Though this system is not well-documented at the moment, you can find relevant code in the `Cspray\\AnnotatedContainer\\LogicalConstraint` namespace. This document is intended to act as a long-running list for the types of logical constraints that have been accounted for, are planned to account for, or are intentionally not going to account for. A future phase of the project will involve implementing the logical constraints listed here.\r\n\r\nConstraints are categorized by their type. The current constraint types are:\r\n\r\n- **Notice** These might indicate something is wrong but could be handled at runtime\r\n- **Warning** There is a large probability that this constraint violation will result in some error\r\n- **Critical** It is all but certain that attempting to use the code in this configuration will result in an error.\r\n\r\n## Accounted For Constraints\r\n\r\n- [x] If an abstract service does not have any concrete services defined for it. _Warning_\r\n- [x] If an abstract service has more than 1 alias defined for it. _Notice_\r\n\r\n## Planned to Account For Constraints\r\n\r\nWhile this is intended to be an exhaustive list it might be possible that conditions exist the author has not considered. If you believe that there's a violation missing in this list of constraints please comment below.\r\n\r\n### Critical\r\n\r\n- [ ] If you duplicate the name of a `#[Service]`.\r\n- [ ] If you annotate a class method with `#[ServiceDelegate]` that has private or protected visibility.\r\n\r\n### Warning\r\n\r\n- [ ] If you annotate a class property with `#[Inject]` without also annotating the class with `#[Configuration]`. _Warning_\r\n\r\n### Notice\r\n\r\n## Intentionally Will-Not-Fix\r\n\r\n_No known logical constraints will be ignored._</div>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-18T21:19:06Z"},{"id":"22410918473","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":71948498,"name":"localstack/localstack","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/6297/events","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297","id":1275822463,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBEnY0s455PXd","number":6297,"title":"Add HEALTHCHECK to Dockerfile","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2022-06-18T15:54:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T18:12:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/6297","html_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297","diff_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/6297.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nThanks for the useful software!

I wouldn't necessarily want to impede on this type of workflow. I'd be open to providing a way to \"fake\" the health check for this type of use case.

Perhaps this Dockerfile becomes the one to use for one-off running and a `Dockerfile.infra` (or similar) has the healthcheck. I'm not familiar enough with the project to be able to know what other repercussions this might have.\r\n\r\nFrom a technically pure perspective the separate Dockerfile feels like a better solution.
