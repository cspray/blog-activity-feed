bare-minimum, proof-of-concept implementation for gathering all ReflectionAttributes from a given source. This PR updates the Reflector interface and DefaultReflector implementation to include a reflectAllAttributes() method that will return a list of ReflectionAttribute. Additionally, several type-hints on parameters and method returns have been updated to include Node\\Attribute and ReflectionAttribute where appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is not meant to represent something fully working or ready to be merged in but to spark a conversation on the desired feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi! Thanks for the awesome library! I have a use case for statically analyzing Attributes in a PHP codebase. To facilitate this I added a `Reflector::reflectAllAttributes()` method that will return a list of ReflectionAttribute instances. Before I continued with this work I wanted to get the maintainers feedback to:\r\n\r\n1. See if this feature is even desired by the team and would be open to merging in to the codebase.\r\n2. Collaborate on possible concerns with the implementation and to solidify the changes to the Reflector API.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n1. Finish testing and implementing the `ReflectionAttribute::createFromNode` method to construct the correct reflection for the node that owns the attribute.\r\n2.
