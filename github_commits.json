There might be several comparisons, in the case of several requests mocked in one test, and we still don't have a clean way of displaying this information. Additional work on this issue needs to include:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Exposing the failed matcher logs in a clean way, either to stdout/stderr or a file.\r\n- [ ] Creating a better format for matcher logs to

having only 1 `DefinitionProvider` in the actual runtime code makes it easy to know precisely what third-party services are getting configured it makes for a clunky developer experience trying to make sure all the disparate classes are invoked properly. This is a problem that can be solved by how we configure DefinitionProvider for bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nWe can introduce a `CompositeDefinitionProvider` that takes _n_ `DefinitionProvider` and run all of them. The XML configuration can be updated to allow configuration multiple `DefinitionProvider` instances. The Bootstrap can then compose an appropriate `CompositeDefinitionProvider` with the correct instances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-06T15:51:38Z"},{"id":"26901193697","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":771345,"login":"cspray","display_login":"cspray","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?"},"repo":{"id":354553154,"name":"cspray/annotated-container","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container"},"payload":{"action":"opened","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/270","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/270/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/270/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/issues/270/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container/issues/270","id":1572815316,"node_id":"I_kwDOFSINQs5dv0HU","number":270,"title":"Allow configuration file to specify definition providers and observers as package private","user":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2883512617,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODgzNTEyNjE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cspray/annotated-container/milestones/20/labels","id":8380230,"node_id":"MI_kwDOFSINQs4Af99G","number":20,"title":"v2.0.0 Release","description":"","creator":{"login":"cspray","id":771345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray","html_url":"https://github.com/cspray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cspray/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":3,"closed_issues":6,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-09-04T16:18:51Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T15:45:39Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-02-06T15:45:39Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T15:45:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"In #144 the scanned vendor directories will have their observers and definition providers included.
